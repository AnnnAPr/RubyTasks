# Ruby and Python Tasks

There are the files with code on **Ruby** (.rb) in this repository.
Every file has **description** on the top of file (in comments) about what code does.

You can run code on this playground https://repl.it/languages/ruby to see how it works and what it does.

The tasks and Python code are in Google Colab. Code could be run directly in Google Colab.
